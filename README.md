#### Performed descriptive analysis on the database, including basic KPIs and BI problems.

Advanced SQL concepts are used, such as unions, joins, window functions, CTEs, views, aggregate functions, and nested queries.

Note: The cleaned dataset was inserted as a flat file.

Note: In some cases, BI Problems statements can give irrelevant output as they were designed to showcase SQL proficiency only.
